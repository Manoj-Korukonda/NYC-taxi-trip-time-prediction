# NYC-taxi-trip-time-prediction

Data and Problem Statement:

The data used in this study are all subsets of New York City Taxi, which contains observations on around 1.4 million+ of New York City taxi rides in the year 2016. To build the models, 1 million observations were used, of which 800,000+ were used for training and 200,000+ for validation. 
The main objective is to build a predictive model, which could help in predicting the duration time of the ride. This would in turn help them in matching the right cabs with the right customers quickly and efficiently.
